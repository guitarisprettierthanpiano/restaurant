A front end restaurant website with a colorful theme. It is purely front end. One of my first projects.

How it is made:
A front end react app with a react-router-dom routed for each web page. The header is static. The map is from Mapbox and centered in downtown Raleigh. I tried to put a few animations for each page to keep it interesting.
